Atlantic winds ripple the heather and the the bracken across the tree-less Dartmoor hills

A seagull rides the wind back and forth as if carried by the cool breath of God bringing wordless news to me, a lone hiker in this wilderness

Taking shelter by the ruined walls of some long deserted monastery where other souls once worshipped too.

Their chants echoing in my heart. A family awakened across time by the whispers of moorland, ocean and winds. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8bd33507-0207-43e8-8bde-51030f42d49c.png)
