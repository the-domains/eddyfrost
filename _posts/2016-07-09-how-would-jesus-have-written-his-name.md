  Although Jesus would have written and read formal ancient Hebrew and Greek,
  the street language and script when The Lord Jesus Christ lived in Galilee was
  Aramaic - a form of Hebrew. In the Dead Sea Scrolls there is wonderful example
  of written Aramaic in the scroll known as the Habakkuk Commentary, or scroll
  '1QpHab', dating from 30 BC to 1 AD, so representsative of how Aramaic was
  being written just as Christ was born. (You can view an extracted Aramaic
  alphabet from that scroll here.) With some help from Dr Douglas Stuart of
  Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary I've used that source to build how Jesus
  would have written his name. The word 'Jesus' is our very Anglicized form of
  the name 'Yeshua' - Jesus in Aramaic (and Hebrew). Aramaic has no written
  vowels, so only the consonants would have been written - Y-Sh-W-'h. The
  writing runs from right to left - the opposite of our way of writing. So the
  names of the Aramaic characters is yodh, shin, waw, 'ayin. This is the best
  shot we have at how Jesus himself would have written his name. Here it is:
